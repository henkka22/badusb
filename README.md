# badusb

This repository includes some BadUSB scripts. Currently I own only Teensy 4.1 so scripts will be only for it unless I get new devices


## usage

For flashing your teensy board you need [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)  (not MS store one), [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html) and teensy board (obviously :D)
